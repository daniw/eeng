Possible signs from a fire to detect are heat, smoke and light. For all of 
those a specific type of fire detector exists. Detectors can use a single 
sensor or a combination of sensors to detect fires and suppress false alarms. 
The detectors are connected to the ??? via a two wire bus with a ring 
topology. Therefore in case of a short circuit the whole system remains 
active. In the model use as example the configuration can be changed wireless. 
The communication is based on radio frequency and light. 

The printed circuit board (PCB) is based on glass fibre reinforced resin. This 
is coated with a thin layer of copper. The traced are structured via etching. 
The structured PCB ist then coated with green solder stop. This reduces the 
risk of short circuit in the soldering process. The PCB can be labeled with a 
white silk screen to mark component positions or add notes or component 
designators. When the PCB is completed, the components can be soldered. 
Therefore the components are placed in an automated pick and place machine 
after solder paste has been applied. The soldering process is executed??? in 
an oven where the solder paste is heated above its melting temperature.
