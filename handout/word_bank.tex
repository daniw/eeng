        Definition\\
    Arranged &
        Order of devices within a topology \\
    Aspirating detector &
        Fire detector that uses a fan to suck air through a pipe to detect 
        smoke in a remote location. \\
    Designator &
        Label to name a component \\
    Flame detector &
        Fire detector that is sensitive to flames. \\
    Linear detector &
        Fire detector that is able to detect smoke in a line of sight or heat 
        along a wire. \\
    Manual call point &
        Box with a small glass window or a pushbutton to alarm the fire 
        brigade manually. It is typically red to increase visibility. \\
    Pick and place &
        Proces in which a machine picks up components from belts or rails and 
        places them on the PCB \\
    Point detector &
        Fire detector that is typically mounted on the ceiling of a room and 
        is only capable of detecting a fire on the place it is mounted. \\
    Printed circuit board (PCB) &
        Board on which electronic components are mounted \\
    Ring topology &
        Cable formed as loop\\
    Short circuit &
        Electrically conductive connection between two wires that should not 
        be connected \\
    Silk screen &
        Covering to print component outlines and text on PCB\\
    Smouldering fire &
        Combustion without open flame and typically only little visible smoke 
        and released heat. \\
    Solder stop &
        Coating on PCB to stop solder from flowing to avoid short circuits \\
    Soldering &
        Process to melt solder paste to permanently connect the components 
        electrically and mechanically to the PCB \\
    Solder paste &
        Compound of an alloy made of tin and lead mixed with solder flux \\
